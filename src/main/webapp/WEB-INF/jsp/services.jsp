<h1>Openings</h1>

<p>Your pool opening can set the standard for your summer fun! The last thing anyone wants to do is spend their spring battling their green pool. Allow Shiny Pools to bring the solution to your pool and busy life. We don't even require that you be at home. All we need is access to an outdoor source of water and power to your pool filter equipment. A Shiny Pools opening includes:

Filter De-winterization

Cleaning and folding your pool cover

Installing all return attachments, ladders, and rails

Opening chemicals such as shock and algaecide

Skimming debris from the top of the pool and a full pool brush.

To most effectively give your pool a head start into the season, let Shiny Pools pump the debris and sediment from the bottom of your pool using our own pumps.

If you are on a deadline or perhaps you have done the heavy lifting and your pool just won't clear, ask about our clean and clear guarantee.



Maintenance

Shiny Pools provides a weekly service. Much like a landscaping service we will arrive weekly and maintain your pool. For new homeowners that have never worked with a pool, this service is a must! A pool professional will cover all the bases to keep your pool shiny and clear. Each visit will last at the very least 30 minutes. A Shiny Pools professional will want to leave your pool pristine for the coming week. Scheduling can be adjusted with prior notice to accommodate before or after events involving pool use such as, barbeques, birthday parties, or any manner of pool party! A shiny pools weekly maintenance includes:

Chemical balancing

A pool vacuum

Clearing debris from the skimmer system and polaris systems

A full pool brushing

As needed filter cleaning and D.E maintenance.

Some pools have more usage, or more debris falling into it on a week to week basis. Your Shiny Pools professional will discuss, coach, and teach you what you need to know so your pool stays clear, clean, and safe. Simply put, one weekly maintenance may not keep your pool up to a Shiny Pools standard. However, Shiny Pools is committed to being there for our weekly maintenance members with unlimited phone support.
