            With over 10 years experience there isn't much we haven't seen in a residential backyard.
            Pools of varying shapes and sizes. Filter systems of varying efficiency.
            Covers that can hold an elephant, or just as easily cause a homeowner some frustration
            year after year. Whatever may be the case, ShinyPools has made it our mission to work with
            and advise you on the best methods to understand your pool cleaning needs. The owner
            and operator of this company Daniel J Kern grew up with a pool. He knows how much love and
            joy a pool can bring to a family and all of their friends and loved ones. ShinyPools wants
            to be a part of your community by providing a service that leaves you saying "WOW".
